Agenda
Topics to be covered in the class are as follows:

JS refresher
TypeOf Operator
Objects and JSON
JS Code Execution - Hoisting and Execution Context
Hoisting
Execution Context
let, var, and const:


JavaScript is a

dynamically typed
high-level programming language
connection with Java
dynamic typed language
statically typed lang



dynamically typed vs statically 

dynamically typed (JS)

let x=10;
x = "hello";
x= true;


statically typed (Java , C, C++)

int x =10;
x="hello";





Strongly Types vs Weaky Typed 


A strongly typed language enforces strict rules about how you use variables of different types. You can’t mix types freely without explicitly converting them.



//python 

"5" + 5  , Error 

int("5") + 5


//Javascript 

A weakly typed language is more relaxed—it will automatically convert types in many cases (this is called "type coercion")

"5"+ 5 : "55" 
"5"-2  : 3
true + 1 : 2




Dynamically + Strongly  (Python)
Statically + Weakly : C
Dyanmically + Weakly  : (JS)
Statically + Strongly : (Java)


Does browsers understand JS by default ?



Chrome : V8 
FireFox : SpiderMonkey 
Edge : Chakra 



The JS engine does:

Parsing: Converts JS code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

Compilation: Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to convert code to machine code

Execution: Runs the compiled code line-by-line


JS is a client side programming language



NodeJS 

Chrome's V8 engine 


that every server side programming language 
(understand http request, interact with filesystems , 
interact with DB)
