Block 

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and takes up the full width available (by default).


Key Characteristics:

Starts on a new line

Takes 100% of the container’s width (unless width is specified)

Can have width, height, margin, padding applied

Stack one after another vertically

<div>, <p>, <h1>-<h6>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, etc.



Inline 

An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. It flows with the text, like a word in a sentence.


 Key Characteristics:

Stays on the same line as other inline elements/text

Cannot set width or height

Can apply padding and margin, but only horizontally

Commonly used for styling parts of text



<span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <b>, <i>, <label>, etc.



inline block 

inline-block elements behave like inline elements (i.e., sit on the same line), but can accept box properties like width and height — a combination of inline and block.

justfiyContent : how to arrange items across the main axis 

flex-start
flex-end 
center



justify-content: flex-start;
Flex items are aligned at the beginning of the container (left for a row layout, top for a column layout).
justify-content: flex-end;
Flex items are aligned at the end of the container (right for a row layout, bottom for a column layout).
justify-content: center;
Flex items are centered along the container's main axis.
Equal space is added before the first item and after the last item, creating a balanced appearance.
justify-content: space-between;
Flex items are evenly spaced along the main axis.
The first item aligns with the container's start, the last item aligns with the container's end, and equal space is added between the items.
justify-content: space-around;
Flex items are evenly spaced along the main axis, with space distributed around them.
Space is added before the first item, after the last item, and between each pair of items.
justify-content: space-evenly;
Flex items are evenly spaced along the main axis, with equal space added between them.
Equal space is added before the first item, between all items, and after the last item.
